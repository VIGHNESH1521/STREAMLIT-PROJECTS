Streamlit is a free and open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps. It is a Python-based library specifically designed for machine learning engineers. Data scientists or machine learning engineers are not web developers and theyâ€™re not interested in spending weeks learning to use these frameworks to build web apps. Instead, they want a tool that is easier to learn and to use, as long as it can display data and collect needed parameters for modeling. Streamlit allows you to create a stunning-looking application with only a few lines of code.
